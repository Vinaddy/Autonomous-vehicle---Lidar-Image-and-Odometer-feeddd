# Autonomous-vehicle using Lidar-Image-and-Odometer-feed
This a part of my college project where we were working on simulating an AV using Lidar, image and ordometer inputs. 
The simulations were extremely successful after they were trained on a 5000 true data images data set. The simulation were performed on the Ubuntu OS using Gazebo.

The data set files have not been uploaded here
